You know how when you search for something on Google, it gives you a list of results? That's because of data science - the computer is using lots of data to figure out what you're looking for and give you the best options. Data science can also help companies figure out what products people are interested in buying, or help doctors predict which patients are at risk for certain diseases. It's all about using data to make smarter choices
